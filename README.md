My implementation of the Magnets game from [Simon Tatham's puzzle collection](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/).

All code (and bugs) is my own, based on playing the game. I have browsed Simon's source, but am not using any of it.

This generates boards randomly and then attempts to solve them.
